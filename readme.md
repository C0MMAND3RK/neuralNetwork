## Disclaimer
Please don't expect high quality code as I'm just playing around with some possibilities. 
I try to use as less as possible frameworks as I want to improve my skills with coding as much as possible by myself.
That said it doesn't mean that I wouldn't like to hear your feedback to the code (style, performance, etc.).

### Description of content
This repo is supposed once to contain the sourcecode for a feed forward artificial neural network written in Java. 
As the project develops this file will be extended.
